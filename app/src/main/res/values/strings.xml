    Using Creative Commons Public Licenses\n\n

    Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
    conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
    original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
    and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
    following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
    exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n

    Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
    intended for use by those authorized to give the public
    permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
    copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
    irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
    and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
    Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
    applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
    material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
    material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
    licensed material, or material used under an exception or
    limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
    wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n\n

    Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
    licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
    licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
    the licensor\'s permission is not necessary for any reason--for
    example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
    copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
    licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
    other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
    the licensed material may still be restricted for other
    reasons, including because others have copyright or other
    rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
    such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
    Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
    respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations
    for the public:\n

    ==========================\n\n\n

    Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License\n\n

    By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
    to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
    Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
    extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
    granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
    these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
    consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
    Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n


    Section 1 -- Definitions.\n\n

    a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
    Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
    and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
    arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
    permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
    Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
    Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
    Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
    synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n

    b. Adapter\'s License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
    and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
    accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n

    c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
    closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
    performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
    Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
    categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
    specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
    Rights.\n\n

    d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
    absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
    fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
    Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
    agreements.\n\n

    e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
    any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
    that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n

    f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
    or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
    License.\n\n

    g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
    terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
    all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
    Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n

    h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
    under this Public License.\n\n

    i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
    process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
    as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
    dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
    available to the public including in ways that members of the
    public may access the material from a place and at a time
    individually chosen by them.\n\n

    j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
    resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
    the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
    as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
    equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\n

    k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
    under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n


    Section 2 -- Scope.\n\n

    a. License grant.\n\n

    1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
    the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
    non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
    exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n

    a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
    in part; and\n\n

    b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n

    2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
    Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
    License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
    its terms and conditions.\n\n

    3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
    6(a).\n\n

    4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
    Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
    all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
    and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
    Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
    authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
    necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
    technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
    Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
    simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
    (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n

    5. Downstream recipients.\n\n

    a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
    recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
    receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
    Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
    Public License.\n\n

    b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
    any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
    apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
    Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
    Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
    Material.\n\n

    6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
    may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
    are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
    with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
    the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
    provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n

    b. Other rights.\n\n

    1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
    licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
    privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
    the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
    assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
    extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
    Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n

    2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
    Public License.\n\n

    3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
    collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
    Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
    under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
    licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
    reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n


    Section 3 -- License Conditions.\n\n

    Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
    following conditions.\n\n

    a. Attribution.\n\n

    1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
    form), You must:\n\n

    a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
    with the Licensed Material:\n\n

    i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
    Material and any others designated to receive
    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
    designated);\n\n

    ii. a copyright notice;\n\n

    iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n

    iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
    warranties;\n\n

    v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n

    b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
    retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n

    c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
    Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
    hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n

    2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
    reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
    which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
    reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
    hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
    information.\n\n

    3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
    information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
    reasonably practicable.\n\n

    4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter\'s
    License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
    Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n


    Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\n

    Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
    apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n

    a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
    to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
    portion of the contents of the database;\n\n

    b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
    contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
    Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
    Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n

    c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
    all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\n

    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
    replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
    Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n


    Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n

    a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
    EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
    AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
    ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
    IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
    WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
    ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
    KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
    ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n

    b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
    TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
    NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
    INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
    COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
    USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
    DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
    IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n

    c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
    above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
    possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
    waiver of all liability.\n\n


    Section 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n

    a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
    Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
    this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
    terminate automatically.\n\n

    b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
    Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n

    1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
    it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
    violation; or\n\n

    2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n

    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
    right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
    of this Public License.\n\n

    c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
    Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
    distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
    will not terminate this Public License.\n\n

    d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
    License.\n\n


    Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n

    a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
    terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n

    b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
    Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
    independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n


    Section 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n

    a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
    shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
    conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
    be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n

    b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
    deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
    minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
    cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
    without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
    conditions.\n\n

    c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
    failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
    Licensor.\n\n


    d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
    as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
    that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
    processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n
